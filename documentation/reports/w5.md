## Report

Wasted Thursday trying to build a .jar file. No luck with external tools, Gradle or IntelliJ (IDE). Always either missing a class or JavaFX file(s). Will ship with gradlew.

Cleaned up the code and wrote more tests. Noticed a small bug with the board and fixed it. No improvement on the solver though.
