## Report

This week I managed to complete all the goals I set previously. I configured checkstyle and jacoco, and wrote a MVP of the algorithm. I also managed to successfully migrate from Maven to Gradle. There was no other real reason than that configuring Gradle is much easier. I also appreciate having simple commands like gradle build, run and test. Makes writing the instructions a lot easier. 

The MVP of the algorithm has come along quite nice. So far it has gotten the high score of 256 which is a long way from 2048 but it's progress nonetheless. When I was writing the solver, I noticed problems with the code structure and did some refactoring. One major change was to make Board a static utility class. Creating a new board for each node of the minimax tree was way too memory intensive.

The question of the week is: why doesn't the algorithm get a higher score than 256? Well, for some reason when increasing the depth limit over two, a certain missbehavior starts. I have hard-coded a weighted board for scoring which somehow breaks. Also one extra improvement I would like to do is to make the board a 64 bit integer as planned. Now it's a 2D array of four integers which is absolute more memory intesive. The operations on the 2D array take also a lot more time compared to bit switching.

Next week my goal is to make some UI improvements and fix the solving algorithm. For now I haven't bothered with writing unit tests for the solver as it changes constantly.
