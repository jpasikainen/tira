## Report

The progress has been very decent this week. I managed to fix the algorithm and score 2048. It is the desired goal, but other implementations around the internet score way higher using similar heuristics so there must be something fishy going on in my code. Earlier I had some difficulties with variable types. For example, I was using long to store the alpha value and then multiplied it by a decimal number (float). This caused the algorithm to behave unpredictably and took way too long for me to figure out. I thought this kinds of things would be noticed by the compiler.

Testing has come along nicely as well. I did some major refactoring and had to pretty much rewrite all the tests. I also managed to do some tests for the solver, but it is still lacking quite a lot and I'm not sure if I even want to add more. I also managed to write some documentation and tools to help with analyzing the performance of the solver.
