## Report

This week I began to write the basic game logic. Creating it took couple of iterations but I think I managed to get it done correctly. There are still some bugs left. For example, the game never ends. There are couple of unnecessary for loops which will be replaced with more elegant solution in the future. For now it's enough to get started with the solver algorithm.

I also added javadoc, jacoco, checkstyle and junit. Now the project can be developed with consistency. There are still a lot of checkstyle errors left, especially in the GUI department. While adding these tools, I noticed that I created the project with Maven, not Gradle. It doesn't seem to be a problem since my IDE (IntelliJ IDEA) does the configuration heavy lifting.

Next week I will start to implement the solver algorithm itself. So far there doesn't seem to be any unbreakable obstacles in the way. I will also have to check the checkstyle configuration document and see if it's too strict.
