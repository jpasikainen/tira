## Report

This week I began to write the specification documentation for the first submission. I started by choosing a topic for the project. After checking out all the examples shown on the course page, I came to a conclusion that making a solver for a game would be the most interesting choise. I wasn't really interested in the games mentioned on the course page so I went to search for something else. After some searching, I chose a game called "2048". The game didn't seeme to have complex graphics nor a lot of rules. I also found a lot of material on how other's have implementated the solver before me.

After writing down the description of the game, I started to plan the execution. My first idea was to use minimxa-algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. After doing more research, I noticed that expectimax suited much better. I haven't used minimax-like algorithms before so my first challenge was to figure out how it works.

In my opinion, the scope of the project matched exactly the examples for game solvers shown on the course page. The specification document is not as detailed as I hoped it to be but I think it gets the job done for now.

Next I will start to implement the minimal GUI and the game logic. Depending on how long these tasks take, I might have some time to work on the solver itself.
